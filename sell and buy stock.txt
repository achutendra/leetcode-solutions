n= number of prices 
p[i] = price of ith element
find the maximum profit 
find the day to sell the stock
and find the day to buy a stock
if u can not acchieve profit return 0


example- 
p = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
n = 6
the lowest price of the stock is on the 2nd day =1
starting from the 2nd of the stock the highest price is on 
5th day =6
6-1 = 5
p = [7,6,4,3,1]
lowest price on day 5 =1
maximum profit made = 0

p = [7,8,7]

algorithm -

buy =  price[0]
maxprofit  = 0
for(i=1;i<n;i++){
	if (buy > price[i]){
		buy = price[i]
	}
	elseif (price[i] - buy > maxprofit){
		maxprofit = price[i] - buy
	}
}
buy = 7
maxprofit =0

step1
if 7 > 1
	buy = 1
maxprofit = 0

step2
if 1 > 5
elseif 5-1 > 0
	maxprofit  = 4

step3
if 1 > 3
elseif 3 -1 > 4


solution

var maxProfit = function(prices) {
    let max = 0;
    for(let i=0; i< prices.length; i++){
        let buy = prices[i]
        for(let j=i+1; j<prices.length; j++){
            let sell = prices[j];
            if(sell > buy && (sell - buy > max )){
                max = sell - buy;
            }
        }
    }
    return max
};

result - limit time exceeds

2nd solution

var maxProfit = function(prices) {
    let left = 0; // Buy
  let right = 1; // sell
  let max_profit = 0;
  while (right < prices.length) {
    if (prices[left] < prices[right]) {
      let profit = prices[right] - prices[left]; // our current profit

      max_profit = Math.max(max_profit, profit);
    } else {
      left = right;
    }
    right++;
  }
  return max_profit;
};
